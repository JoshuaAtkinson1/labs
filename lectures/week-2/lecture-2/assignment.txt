Your assignment is to make a resource other than a library, and create a list of items 
within it (no need for relations).


Note: please test your code using console.log's so I can run the file and check (and for yourself)
Note: check out the debugging resources below

- pick an item, it can be anything: (planes trains auto (anything))
- make a schema for it
- list several of them like I have (in a javascript array)

add this list to the same four files as I have 
create.js
update.js
delete.js
read.js

READ
use the code that i have to build your read functions

- for the whole list 
- for a find by ([insert attribute here] attribute) 
ie: find book by title
- for another find by ([insert attribute here] attribute

[difficulty: medium] BONUS: make a function that can find by any attribute that you pass in as an argument

[difficulty: hard] Double bonus: make a function that can search for all the items that have either of two attributes
ie: find any books that have category "russian" or that are length "long"

CREATE 
use the code that i have to build your create functions

add a record to your collection

[difficulty: medium] BONUS: allow bulk updates
ie: pass me several records and I will add them all
resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat

[difficulty: hard] Add validations for your required schema attributes
ie: do NOT add this book if it doesn't have a title 
ie: do NOT add this book if it's in the category "old"

DELETE 
use the code that i have to build your delete functions

delete a record to your collection

[difficulty: hard] BONUS: only delete ONE record, not all for a particular book title
ie: I delete only 1 copy of harry potter (we need this function if someone buys/rents a copy)

Resources:
-------

debugging javascript:
we'll probably have a lecture on this, or [find article - TBD]

stack trace - find the line where it's failing
read the error - the part at the top that reads like english
    write down each term and look up words you don't know
    copy that and paste into google

-------

type these into google WITHOUT the mdn code word and you'll get resources like "w3 schools" that may be a bit
easier to read: getting familiar with Docs (like mdn) is important though, these exist for all technologies in coding

for loop - mdn - javascript
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for

push operation on an array - mdn - javascript
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push

concat operation on an array - mdn - javascript
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat

NOT operator + others 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_NOT

(in every interview they ask the difference between strict and non-strict tldr: use strict)
