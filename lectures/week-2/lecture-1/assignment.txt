Choose one of the "things" you made from our first assignment (or one of the "things" 
that I created in our lecture (person / dog / cat /etc)). Do not choose a car 

Create 3 different examples of schemas for that "thing" and for each, describe how they are different.
ie: less attributes / same data but the key is named differently / missing data etc 

Create a "model" / "ideal" schema, that is going to be your regular schema that you want after all of these 
are transformed.

Using dot syntax for changing attributes, change each of these objects manually into the "model" / "ideal" schema,
and console.log each before and after result.

Bonus: Use the function I built to dynamically change all of your objects, instead of just manually changing them

Double Bonus: Describe in a txt file:
Apply your thing or choose a new thing to apply real life app example (Enterprise and Budget data coming from 
different sources to be shown in Kayak).
